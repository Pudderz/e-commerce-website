# E-Commerce Website

Demo - https://e-commerce-website-j8wvkus9z-pudderz.vercel.app/

## features
* login Authentication
* google analytics to create a most popular section
* Stripe.js for payments
* MongoDB GraphQL backend with queries and mutations with authentication using JWT access tokens

## To Do

* Add error handler for when payment isnt received
* verify contents of cart can be purchased(in stock)
* create Admin pages
* move all products over to MongoDB from commerce.js
* Add searchBar
* Add filter options to category and store pages
* Add darkMode option

## Improvements
* Don't use commerce.js and use mongoDB and a something like a CDN for the images. This would make most of the backend on one server and allows us to quickly query result.
