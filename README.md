## To Do
* Add error handler for when payment isnt received
* verify contents of cart can be purchased(in stock)
* setup backend for demo
* shipping form
## Improvements
* Don't use commerce.js and use mongoDB and a something like a CDN for the images. This would make most of the backend on one server and allows us to quickly query result.
