        "description": "Generally speaking its a good tablet, it works nicely though there are quite a few bugs with the touch controls and the buttons sometimes decide not to work. I would normally brush these off but after spending £500 it seems only fair to point them out. However my biggest complain is that the nibs are just awful, I've had it for less than a week and the first nib is completely unusable and I'm halfway through the second nib. I Must have used it for less than 5 hours so far. It does come with replacement nibs but at the current rate they will last me till the end of the month at tops. When I contacted Wacom they suggested I get the smooth texture to apply to my tablet, I wouldn't mind but they cost £40 each which in my opinion is really cheeky including I've just spend £500 on a new tables. Its a shame because other than that I've enjoyed using the product so far. Not sure if I'd recommend honestly."
